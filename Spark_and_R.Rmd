## Spark

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing as mentioned on the 
official [project's page](http://spark.apache.org/). For many it is considered to be the successor
of the popular hadoop engine.

Spark has considerably increased in popularity in the last years since:

* It is easy to implement with existing technologies. It can run on:
    * Hadoop
    * Mesos
    * Standalone
    * In the cloud
  And it can also access diverse data sources including:
    * HDFS
    * Cassandra
    * HBase 
    * S3
* It runs programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in RAM or 10x faster on disk.
* It is implemented in a plethora of languages like:
    * Java
    * Scala
    * Python
    * R

## R

R is a statistical programming language (could also be considered a general purpose language
after latest developments) and it is one of the languages used to run Spark for statistical / data
analysis.

In this course we will explore the two main R packages used to run data analysis on Spark:

* SparkR - natively included in Spark after version 1.6.2
* sparklyr - developed by RStudio

## Installation of Spark and Hadoop and versions

#### Versions and Spark Mode

I spent a considerable amount of time, trying to find out exactly which combination of Hadoop and 
spark would work with both SparkR and sparklyr (these are very new packages and there are still
some issues, especially with the recent update of Spark to version 2.0.1). According to my research
Spark version 2.0.1 (the most recent at the time of writing) and Hadoop version 2.4 seem to work
perfect with both SparkR and sparklyr. For the rest of the course 

I used the [standalone mode of Spark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html) and
I am also working on Windows 10.

```{R}
sessionInfo()
```

#### Installation of Spark and Hadoop

The easiest way to install Spark Standalone and Hadoop is through `sparklyr::spark_install`:

```{R, eval = TRUE}
#install Spark 2.0.1 and Hadoop 2.4
#sparklyr version 0.4.22 
library(sparklyr)
spark_install(version = '2.0.1', hadoop_version = '2.4')
```

After the download and installation of Spark and Hadoop (this might take a while) we are ready to 
start using `SparkR` and `sparklyr`.

For clarity your spark and hadoop versions by default will be installed in:

`C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Local\rstudio\spark\Cache\spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.4`

## RStudio

`SparR` is native to Spark since version 1.6.2 and can be immediately used through the command line.
`sparklyr` can be used after loading the package `sparklyr`. However, most users (including myself)
like working on an IDE (this is why we have IDEs, right?) like RStudio. In fact the [RStudio preview Release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) includes a toolset for 
creating / managing spark connections and browsing Spark DataFrames and has specifically been 
designed to work with Spark.

For the rest of the course we will be using the RStudio preview release which can be downloaded for
free in the link above.

#### Installation of sparklyr and SparkR

`sparklyr` is readily available on CRAN so running `install.packages('sparklyr')` would be enough.
Things are slightly more complicated for `SparkR` since it has to be downloaded and installed from 
github. Nothing too difficult though:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
#you will need the devtools package to install packages from github
#so install.packages('devtools') if you don't have it
library(devtools)
install_github('apache/spark@v2.0.1', subdir='R/pkg')
```

<div style='background-color:lightgray;border-radius: 5px;border: 2px solid #73AD21;'>
Remember that working through the
command line SparkR can be done simply by visiting 
`C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Local\rstudio\spark\Cache\spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.4\bin\` and 
double clicking sparkR.exe or simple by running sparkR on windows cmd if the above path is 
part of the environment variable `%path%`.
</div>

And that would be enough to have both sparklyr and SparkR.

## SparkR

Our first task would be to connect RStudio to spark using SparkR.

To do this we need first need to set the `SPARK_HOME` environment variable (don't worry we will 
do it through R and it will be super easy) and then connet to spark through `spark.session`:

```{R}
#lots of base R functions will be masked so please use SparkR only for working with Spark
#remember to use your own username instead of teoboot which is mine
#this sets the SPARK_HOME environment variable
Sys.setenv(SPARK_HOME = "C:/Users/teoboot/AppData/Local/rstudio/spark/Cache/spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.4")

#SparkR version 2.0.1
library(SparkR, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

#start a spark R session in SparkR.
#by not setting the SPARK_HOME environment variable sparkR.session will attempt to download it
sc1 <- sparkR.session()
```

For the following analysis we will be using the popular `flights` from the `nycflights13` 
package.

Firstly, typical data frame operations in local R would involve subseting columns, rows, grouping
and aggregating. Let's see how we can do this in SparkR:

```{R}
#load the package in order to use flights
library(nycflights13)

#create a dataframe
df <- createDataFrame(flights)

#in order to subset columns from flights we use select
head(select(df, df$air_time, df$distance)) 

#another way would be to use the [ operator as we would in a local dataframe
head(df[, c('air_time', 'distance')])

#in order to subset rows we use filter
head(filter(df, df$distance > 3000))

#another way would be to use the [ operator as we would in a local dataframe
#note that subseting the rows of a data.frame with indices would not work
#i.e. df[1:100], ] would not work.
head(df[df$distance > 3000, ])

#in order to group and aggregate we use summarize and groupBY
grouped_df <- groupBy(df, df$origin)
df2 <- summarize(grouped_df, 
                 mean = mean(df$distance), 
                 count = n(df$origin),
                 sum = sum(df$distance))
head(df2)

#in order to sort the data frame we use arrange:
#head(arrange(df2, desc(df2$mean))) for sorting in descending order or
head(arrange(df2, df2$mean)) 

```

However, the above processes can be easily combined with the pipe operater `%>% from the 
`magrittr` package. In this way we can work in a similar way to `dplyr`, `ggvis`, `tableHTML` or
other. The above process would be written like this:

```{R}
library(magrittr)
df3 <- df %>%
        group_by(df$origin)%>%
        summarize(mean = mean(df$distance), 
                         count = n(df$origin),
                         sum = sum(df$distance)) 

arrange(df3, df3$mean) %>% 
 head
```

And as you can see we get the same results.

SparkR also supports the use of SQL commands by registering a table as a sql table

```{R}
#create a sql table
createOrReplaceTempView(df, "sql_df")

#query sql table using sql syntax
df4 <- sql("SELECT * FROM sql_df WHERE distance > 4800")
head(df4)
```

There will be cases where we would want to collect our data sets from spark and work on them 
locally. This can be done using `collect`.

```{R}
#local_df will be a data frame on our local R instance
local_df <- collect(df3)
local_df[1:10, ]
```

## Machine Learning

It is essential for our work to be able to do machine learning on a data set. SparkR offers this
capability through MLlib.

By continuing to use the `flights` data set we will predict distance.

First of all we need to split our data set into a train and a test set with the `randomSplit` 
function. 

```{R}
#split into train and test
df_list <- randomSplit(df, c(20, 80))

#test
test <- df_list[[1]]
nrow(test)

#train
train <- df_list[[2]]
nrow(train)

#validation
nrow(df)
```

Now that we have our train and test sets we are ready to run our glm model. We will train our model
on the train set and then predict on our test set. We will try to predict distance based on some of 
the variables we have.

```{R}
#run model
train <- na.omit(train)
my_mod <- glm(distance ~ air_time, data = train, family = 'gaussian')

#summary
summary(my_mod)
```
